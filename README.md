# RC Copter

Here I'm hacking one of these bad boys, essentially a scaled up version of a Syma107G, to use an Arduino Nano as its controller instead!

The hardware setup for this project, besides the Nano, includes:
- MPU9150 (IMU)
- GPS Module
- NRF24L101 Wireless Transceivers
- CF BDB Tiny Brushed Motor Driver Board: a little module I found on eBay that handily provides PWM-based controller access to up to six motors drawing a maximum of 10 A each.
- LiPO Battery Sensor
